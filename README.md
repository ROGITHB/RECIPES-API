# Recipe Management API

Step 1: Initialize the Project
Run the following commands in your terminal:
mkdir recipe-app
cd recipe-app
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose dotenv



## Description
A simple CRUD application for managing recipes using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone your-repo-url
   cd recipe-app
2.Install dependencies:
`npm install`
3.Create a .env file with your MongoDB URI:
`MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string`
`PORT=3000`

4.Run the application:
npm start
Testing
Use Postman to test the API endpoints. See the request and response examples in the code.

5.Techstacks needs to be used : 
Node.js
Express.js
Mongoose (MongoDB)
Postman

### Conclusion

This guide walks you through creating a CRUD application for recipes using Node.js, Express.js, and Mongoose. The structure is modular and follows the MVC pattern, ensuring that the application is maintainable and easy to understand. You can extend this application further by adding authentication, more complex validation, or integrating front-end frameworks.# Recipe Management API
